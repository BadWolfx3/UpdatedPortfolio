# Updated Portfolio

## Description
Using Bootstrap I created a portfolio webpage that is responsive. It has a navbar that when shrunk will be in hamburger mode and list down. 
When the whole window is shrunk down, the whole page is responsive and sizes with it. Images were made responsive as well.
No media queries are used. 
The grid system is used.
